🚀 Interactive Login Form with User Authentication
📖 Description
This project is a fully functional user authentication system designed with a modern and responsive login form. It provides a secure backend using PHP and MySQL, while the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The system allows users to register, log in, update their profile, and manage accounts efficiently through CRUD operations.

🎯 Features
The login form includes a visually appealing UI with an animated background using CSS animations. It supports secure authentication, ensuring user credentials are protected with password hashing. Input validation is implemented to prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks, making the system robust and secure. Additionally, the application manages user sessions to maintain login states and ensure smooth user interaction. The design is fully responsive, making it compatible with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

📁 Project Structure
The project is structured into multiple files for easy management and scalability. It includes:

index.html for the login page,
register.html for user registration,
dashboard.html for the user profile,
login.php and register.php for backend authentication,
db.php for database connection, and
user_crud.php for CRUD operations.
Additionally, the assets folder contains CSS styles and JavaScript files for frontend enhancements. A users.sql file is provided to set up the necessary database schema in MySQL or MariaDB.

🛠 Technologies Used
The project is built using HTML, CSS (Glassmorphism UI), and JavaScript for the frontend, while PHP and MySQL handle the backend. CSS animations enhance the visual experience, and JavaScript is used for form validation and dynamic interactions. The database stores user information securely, and prepared statements are used to prevent SQL Injection.

🔒 Security Features
The project includes several security mechanisms to protect user data. Passwords are hashed using password_hash() before being stored in the database. SQL Injection protection is implemented using prepared statements, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) prevention is achieved by sanitizing user input. These features ensure that user credentials and session data remain secure.

📝 Future Enhancements
In future updates, additional features such as email verification, password reset functionality, two-factor authentication (2FA), and social login integration (Google, Facebook) will be implemented to further enhance security and usability.
